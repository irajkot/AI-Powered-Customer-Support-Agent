# AI-Powered-Customer-Support-Agent
Built an AI-powered customer support agent that automates email responses using n8n, OpenAI, Pinecone, and Gmail. The system uses a RAG pipeline to retrieve FAQs and policy documents, generate accurate replies, and send professional responses while preserving email threads.
Credentials and API keys have been removed for security.
To run this workflow, configure your own OpenAI, Pinecone, and Gmail credentials in n8n.
